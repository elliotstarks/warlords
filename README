- (auto-mode) client/server hand drops out of sync occasionally
- (auto-mode) player strikes out --> game halted
	- could this be a processing issue?
- last card in hand/played 48-51 -> next player turn
- swap 
	- cards not removed/appended properly?
	- warlord should be first on ranked game - currently scumbag
- new hand - active player/current player out of sync 
- old table message sent before new when next round initiated
- played two cards of the same face value as the one on stack
  --> play not registered - player goes again as if nothing played (reproduce?)
- [42,45,52,52] accepted as valid play (???)
- last player will not timeout - endless strikes
